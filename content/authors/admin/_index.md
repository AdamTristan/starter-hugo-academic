I am a third year undergraduate student at Sichuan University, majoring in Measure Control Technology and Instruments. My research interest includes robotics, computer graphics (simulation) and brain-machine interface. I was advised by [Prof.Xiaodong Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3aaMMgAAAAJ&hl=en) of [SMART lab](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/Smart-X-Lab?lang=en) from Sichuan University and [Prof.Yi Liu](https://yjs.cd120.com/showteacher.asp?id=1004) from West China Hospital of Sichuan University. I am now a visiting student at [westlake university](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) at [CenBRAIN lab](https://cenbrain.westlake.edu.cn/), where I am supervised by [Prof.Moahamad Sawan](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/mohamad-sawan.html).
